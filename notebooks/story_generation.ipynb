With 2 goals scored, significantly above the average of 1.38, the team demonstrated exceptional attacking prowess, which likely caught the model's attention. The team's ability to successfully execute passes at an 89% rate also played a significant role in the prediction, as it indicated a high level of cohesion and teamwork. However, the model also took into account the team's relatively low distance covered during the match, which might have been seen as a potential weakness. On the other hand, the team's ability to take advantage of free kicks, with 24 attempts, was another key factor in the prediction. The model may have viewed this as an indication of the team's willingness to take risks and try new things, which could be beneficial in high-pressure situations like the World Cup. Overall, the combination of these factors led the model to conclude that this team had a strong chance of producing a standout player.\n"
