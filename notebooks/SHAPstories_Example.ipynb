            "As I examined the SHAP table, it became clear that the AI model had pinpointed several key factors that led to its prediction of the team winning the \"Man of the Match\" award. The most influential feature was the number of goals scored by the team, which contributed a significant 1.37 points to the overall prediction. This suggests that the model deemed the team's goal-scoring ability as a major strength.\n",
